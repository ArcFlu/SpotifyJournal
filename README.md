// Authorization Notes\
When planning authorization, we need to know/figure out how login will work.\
Login consists of initial authorization and post authorization, so we need to know
how we will persist the user's credentials.

// getMyRecentlyPlayedTracks
Songs only count towards listening history if it gets to the end of the song, not if you skip it.
When I run the script, I'll schedule it for an hour + 1 minute after.
Edge case: previous day

// I will also have to account for duplicates, I'll probably actually store that data so we can see
// you played it over and over.
